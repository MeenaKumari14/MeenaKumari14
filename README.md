# Hi There, I'm Meena Kumari!

I am a passionate **Data Science Enthusiast** and an **IT Graduate** dedicated to turning complex data into actionable insights. 
I specialize in building predictive models and exploring the intersection of **Generative AI** and Computer Vision.

###  Current Journey
-  **Currently:** Data Science Intern at **CodeAlpha** & Python Developer Intern at **Cognify Technologies**.
-  **Past Experience:** Successfully completed a Data Science & Analysis Internship at **Apexcify Technologies**.
-  **Education:** IT Graduate with a core focus on Data Engineering & Predictive Analytics.

###  Featured Final Year Project (FYP)
#### **AI-Based Skin Disease Detection & Consultation System**
This is my most ambitious project, where I integrated **Computer Vision** with **Generative AI (OpenAI)** to bridge the gap between diagnosis and explanation.

* **The Innovation:** The system identifies skin conditions from images and uses **OpenAI's GPT** to provide detailed, human-like text responses about the condition.
* **Technical Deep Dive:**
    * **Core Logic:** Image Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Classification -> GPT API Integration.
    * **Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenAI API, Flask, Pandas.
    * **Accuracy Note:** Achieved **50% Validation Accuracy** during the initial research phase. 
    * *Note: This project served as a "Proof of Concept," focusing on the complex integration of Multimodal AI (Image + Text) rather than just raw accuracy.*
